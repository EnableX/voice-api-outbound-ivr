# Initiating Outbound IVR Calls with EnableX Programmable Voice APIs: Step-by-Step Guide

Learn how to initiate outbound calls using EnableX Programmable Voice APIs with this step-by-step guide. Clone the repository, set up essential environment variables, and configure webhooks for event notifications. Secure your application with SSL certificates, whether self-signed or registered. Launch the client application script effortlessly to start making outbound calls. Streamline your outbound call process with EnableX Programmable Voice APIs and take your communication to the next level.

## Pre-requisite
- You will need Enablex Application credentials, APP ID and APP KEY. To find credentials, register with EnableX (https://portal.enablex.io/cpaas/trial-sign-up/).
- You will need a place for hosting this application either cloud or local machine.


## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/EnableX/voice-api-outbound-ivr.git`
- `cd voice-api-outbound-ivr`
- `npm install`


## Setting up configurations using environment variables

For Mac and Linux, open a terminal window and type the following commands. Note - Replace all the characters after the = with values from your EnableX account:

- Set APP ID and APP KEY. It is required configuration.
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_ID=`
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_KEY=`

- Set port. Default port is set to 3000. It is an optional configuration.
  - `export SERVICE_PORT=`

For Windows:
  - Make a file with name ".env" in root directory. And copy content of .env.example in .env file. Then set these variables
  - `ENABLEX_APP_ID` , `ENABLEX_APP_KEY` , `SERVICE_PORT`.
  - Their explanation is given in Linux/Mac section (Upper section).


## Webhook - EnableX will send HTTP requests to your application (`/event`) after certain events occur.

For Mac and Linux, open a terminal window and type the following commands. Note - Replace all the characters after the = with values from your EnableX account:

- If you have deployed this service on a web server which is publicly accessible, set the public URL. Example - `https://{PUBLIC_URL}`
  - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`
- If you want to test this service on a web server running locally on your own computer at a given port, with ngrok, you can generate URL that tunnels requests to your web server running locally. Once ngrok installed, run following -
  - `./ngrok http {SERVICE_PORT}` . It should provide you a ngrok URL something similar to `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`. Now, Set the ngrok URL. Example - `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`
    - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`
- Set to run the service on http / https (false / true)
  - `export LISTEN_SSL=`

For Windows

  - In .env file set these values `LISTEN_SSL=`, `PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`.
  - Their explanation is given in Linux/Mac section (Upper section).


## SSL Certificate (Self Signed or Registered). It is required configuration if LISTEN_SSL is set to true.

Mac/Linux

  - Make a directory called certs on the root of the project
    - `mkdir certs`
  - Change to certs directory
    - `cd certs`
  - Create and Install certificates
    - `openssl req -nodes -new -x509   -keyout example.key -out example.crt   -days 365   -subj '/CN=example.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'; cat example.crt > example.ca-bundle`
  - use the certificate .key [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_KEY=`
  - use the certificate .crt [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_CERT=`
  - use the certificate CA[chain] [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_CACERTS=`
  - switch to the root of the project
    - `cd ..`
  
Windows (Using Git Bash):
  - Make a directory called certs on the root of the project
    - `mkdir certs`
  - Change to certs directory
    - `cd certs`
  - Create and Install certificates
    - `openssl req -nodes -new -x509   -keyout example.key -out example.crt   -days 365` 
    - `cat example.crt > example.ca-bundle`
  - Update these fields manually in .env file if not given else you can ignore it. 
    - use the certificate .key [self signed or registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_KEY=`
    - use the certificate .crt [self signed or registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_CERT=`
    - use the certificate CA[chain] [self signed or  registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_CACERTS=`
  - switch to the root of the project
    - `cd ..`

## Starting the client application script
- For Outbound Calls,
```
  - npm install
  - node client-outbound-ivr.js
  
```
